Sreadahead is a daemon that reads data sequential by use from disk. This is typically used to fetch information needed by the boot process into memory as early as possible. Sreadahead thereby eliminates IO wait times during the boot process which results in a faster startup.

Sreadahead is still in development and currently uses an out-of-kernel patch against 2.6.29 (older kernels not supported), but works on all filesystems due to the use of an in-kernel tracer.

Sreadahead contains two major parts: One part reads data at boot to accelerate boot time. The second part generates the boot data (a.k.a. pack file) after a kernel has booted. Depending on whether the pack file is present, sreadahead automatically choses to run either part. Both components are conveniently compiled into a single binary.

To deploy sreadahead, simply make it start as early in the sysvinit boot process. To refresh the pack file, it can be deleted and at the next bootup, it will be autogenerated.
